## Pinellas County Substantial Damage and Substantial Improvement explained

This gives you some information on how Pinellas Country handles the ruling. If we find Largo's official text, we shall replace this one with it.

If you receive a letter in the mail stating that your home is Substantially Damaged, you are required to bring the structure up to flood safety standards. If you disagree with the determination, you may request a re-assessment.
